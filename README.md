# RootFree

A free, private family tree builder that runs entirely in your browser.

No account. No subscription. No server. Your family's history stays on your device.

## The problem with existing tools

Ancestry, MyHeritage, and similar services charge monthly fees, lock your data in proprietary formats, and make their business by owning access to your family's history. When you stop paying, you lose access.

RootFree works the other way around. Everything runs in your browser. Nothing is sent anywhere. You own the data completely, and you can delete it all in one click.

## Features

**Building your tree**
- Add people with name, photo, birth and death years, birthplace, occupation, and notes
- Connect people as parent, child, partner, or sibling
- Drag and reposition cards freely on an infinite canvas
- Auto-arrange by generation or grid with one click

**Viewing your tree**
- Tree view — freeform canvas with relationship lines
- Generations view — automatically groups family by generation, from great-grandparents down to grandchildren
- People view — alphabetical table of everyone in the tree

**Sharing**
- Share a live link with family members — changes sync peer-to-peer in real time
- Choose edit or view-only access when sharing
- No server involved — data travels directly between browsers
- Session ends when everyone closes the tab

**Data portability**
- Import GEDCOM files from Ancestry, MyHeritage, FamilySearch, and any compatible app
- Export to GEDCOM 5.5.1 — the universal genealogy standard
- Backup and restore as JSON
- One-click permanent delete

## Privacy

**Solo mode** — all data is stored in your browser's `localStorage`. Nothing is sent to any server, ever. Clearing your browser storage erases your tree, so export a backup regularly.

**Shared mode** — when you share a tree, data travels directly between browsers using WebRTC peer-to-peer. The signalling server (PeerJS) facilitates the connection but never sees your family data. When the session ends, nothing persists anywhere outside the participants' browsers.

There is no analytics, no tracking, and no backend. The entire product is a single HTML file.

## GEDCOM

[GEDCOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEDCOM) is the standard interchange format for genealogical data, supported by virtually every family tree platform.

RootFree imports and exports GEDCOM 5.5.1, including names, birth and death years, birthplaces, occupations, genders, notes, and family relationships.

**Import from:** Ancestry, MyHeritage, FamilySearch, MacFamilyTree, Gramps, Legacy Family Tree, and any app that exports `.ged` files.

**Export to:** Any of the above. Your data is never trapped.
